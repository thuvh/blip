	* blip.c, common.h, dns-build.c, dns-build.h: + 32 bit random
	number/ip macro + set_dns_type,class to change packet internals
	later on + random class & type + logic fixes while sleeping on a
	'0' + removed error checking for type & class; any thing will work
	(typecast'd of course..) + cleaned up logic to remove expensive
	conditional tests and replaced with flags + display type and class
	being sent in debug mode
